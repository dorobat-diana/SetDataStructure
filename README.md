# SetDataStructure
Project Description:

The "Set Data Structure and Iterator Testing" project is a C++ software development and testing endeavor aimed at creating and rigorously evaluating a custom "Set" data structure and its corresponding iterator. A Set is a data structure that stores unique elements and offers operations like adding elements, removing elements, searching for elements, and iterating through the stored values.

Key Components and Features:

Set Implementation: The project involves the creation of a Set data structure that ensures all stored elements are unique. It supports fundamental operations like adding elements, removing elements, searching for elements, and checking the size of the set.

Iterator Implementation: An iterator class is developed to enable traversal through the elements of the Set. The iterator guarantees that all unique elements are visited, following the order of insertion.

Testing Suite: The project includes an extensive testing suite, encompassing multiple test cases to assess the correctness and performance of the Set data structure and iterator. Test scenarios cover creating, adding, removing, searching, and iterating through elements.

Project Goals:

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

Set Data Structure: To create a reliable and efficient Set data structure that enforces the uniqueness of stored elements while preserving the insertion order.

Iterator Implementation: To implement a functional iterator for the Set data structure, ensuring correct traversal and element retrieval without duplicates.

Comprehensive Testing: To conduct comprehensive testing of the Set data structure and iterator, covering various aspects of functionality, including edge cases.

Efficiency and Performance: To validate the Set's performance regarding element insertion, removal, and iteration under different scenarios.

Robustness: To ensure the Set data structure can handle edge cases gracefully and without memory issues, even with a large number of elements.

Usability: To provide users with a dependable Set data structure and iterator that can be integrated into a variety of C++ projects requiring unique element storage and retrieval.

By achieving these objectives, this project offers a robust Set data structure and iterator that can be employed in diverse software applications. Additionally, it serves as a valuable example of best practices for data structure development and testing in C++.
